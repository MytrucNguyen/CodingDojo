# Hello World

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice the different ways to concatenate and print strings</li>
  <li>Practice running a Python file</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's time to start creating Python files! As a rite of passage, our first program needs to be Hello World :). Let’s practice string concatenation. Copy the code below, replacing each of the your code here placeholders with the appropriate values. Hopefully it's not too patronizing that every other task below is running the file--this is just a friendly reminder to get into the habit of testing your code regularly!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new Python file called hello_world.py</li>
  <li>Write the code to print a literal string saying "Hello World" (#1)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a comma in the print function (#2a)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>Store your name in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{your name}}!” using a + in the print function (#2b)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a comma in the print function (#3a)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>Store your favorite number in a variable, and then use it to print the string “Hello {{num}}!” using a + in the print function (#3b)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>NINJA BONUS: Figure out how to resolve the error from above, without changing the + sign to a comma</li>
  <li>Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with the format method (#4a)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>Store 2 of your favorite foods in variables, and then use them to print the string “I love to eat {{food_one}} and {{food_two}}.” with f-strings (#4b)</li>
  <li>Run the file</li>
  <li>NINJA BONUS: Spend a few minutes playing around with other string methods to see what’s out there!</li>
